# React Setup


## Running the code

After cloning, install third-party modules:

```sh
npm install
```

Then in one command-line window, to have Webpack build the bundle file (Make sure Webpack is installed first), do this:
```sh
webpack
```
or if you want Webpack to listen for any changes...
```sh
webpack -w
```

Then in another command-line window, do this to launch a quick web server:

```sh
http-server
```
